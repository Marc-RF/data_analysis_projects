    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to work with 2 datasets related to exit surveys from employees of the \"Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)\" and \"Technical and Further Education (TAFE)\" intitute, both from Queensland, Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets have been downloaded from the DataQuest guided project page but can also be acquired from here: [TAFE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and [DETE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "For the DETE dataset:\n",
    "- **ID**: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- **SeparationType**: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- **Cease Date**: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- **DETE Start Date**: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "For the TAFE dataset:\n",
    "- **Record ID**: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- **Reason for ceasing employment**: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- **LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)**: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",
